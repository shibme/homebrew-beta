Homebrew Tap
=====================
This is a [Homebrew][brew] tap for software maintained by [Shibly Meeran][shibme].

Setup
-----
Using these formulae requires [Homebrew][brew] to be installed.

Once homebrew is installed, simply run:
```
brew tap shibme/tap
```

Use
---
To install software, just use `brew install` with the name of the formula. You may have to run `brew update` first to get the latest version of the formulae. For example, to install the latest version of [xipher][xipher], run:
```
brew update
brew install xipher
```
or to install [xipher][xipher] directly without setting tap, run:
```
brew install shibme/tap/xipher
